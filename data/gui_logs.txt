[19:15:15] Note the autobidder is only tested on low value cards (such as non-rare golds) with **ONLY 1 version of their card**. 
 Players like Giroud for example, are not good because there are 4 different Giroud cards. 
 I recommend random non-rare golds selling for just under or just above 1,000 coins.
